"""
Every stock change in the system - order deduction, manual recount, restock,
AI photo update - goes through apply_stock_change(). This is the one place
that touches Variant.current_stock, which keeps the "ledger + running
balance stay in sync" guarantee in one spot instead of scattered across
every caller.

CONCURRENCY: two staff could process an order-upload and a manual recount
at the same time. A naive "read stock, subtract in Python, write stock back"
is a classic race condition - two concurrent deductions can both read
stock=5, both decide "5 >= 3, ok", and both write back 2, silently losing
one deduction (final stock should have been -1 short i.e. an error, not 2).

Fix: do the subtraction IN the UPDATE statement, guarded by a WHERE clause,
and let the database's row-level locking make it atomic:

    UPDATE variants SET current_stock = current_stock - :qty
    WHERE id = :id AND current_stock >= :qty

If 0 rows are affected, there wasn't enough stock at the moment the database
actually applied it (not when Python first checked) - so we know for certain,
not just "probably".
